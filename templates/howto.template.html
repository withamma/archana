		<p>How does it work? It's simple. When you start you will see the first verse. This will be followed by a line and underneath it is a ?. Your Job is to say the verse that comes after from memory. Then click Check. This will show you the verse that actually comes after. Now you can indicate whether you got it <strong>right (green)</strong> or <strong>wrong (red)</strong>. If you mark an answer incorrect, undo by clicking the <strong>yellow button</strong> or <strong>swipe left on the screen if you're on a phone</strong>.</p>
