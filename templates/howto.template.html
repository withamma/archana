	<!-- 		<p>Welcome to Archana tester. This will help you find where you make mistakes while doing archana. It will catch if you skip one verse and then show you at the end all of the verses you skipped.</p>
			<p>How does it work? It's simple. When you start you will see the first verse. This will be followed by a line and underneath it is a question mark. Your part is to say the verse that comes after from memory. Then click Check. This will show you the verse that actually comes after. Now you can indicate whether you got it <strong>right (green)</strong> or <strong>wrong (red)</strong>. If you mark an answer incorrect, undo by clicking the <strong>yellow button</strong> or <strong>swipe left on the screen if you're on a phone</strong>.</p>
			<p>After you are done. You can generate a quizlet deck. You don't need a quizlet account, however if you have one, feel free to copy the deck to your own account.</p>
